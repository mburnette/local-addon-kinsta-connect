# Changelog

What changed in each release of ConnectLocal for Kinsta. Add new notes under **Unreleased**; `npm run release`
turns that section into the new version's entry and uses it as the GitHub release notes.

## Unreleased

- Pushing to a folder whose path has a space no longer splits the path on the server, which could make a push
  with **Delete files on Kinsta that are not in Local** land in the wrong folder.
- Each site now keeps its pre-push database backup in a folder of its own (`private/.kinsta-connect/<site folder>`),
  so a second WordPress in a subfolder of `public/` no longer shares (or overwrites) it.
- A database push into a database that also holds another site's tables (a different table prefix) replaces only this
  site's tables instead of resetting the whole database, and stops before changing anything if the Local site's table
  prefix would overwrite the other site's tables. A pull downloads only this site's tables.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-10-31

- New: update checks. The add-on looks for new releases on GitHub when Local starts and every 12 hours, and shows
  an **Update** button in its panel when one is out. **Check for updates** at the bottom of the panel checks right away.
- If you installed 0.1.0 from the website, install this version once by hand (**Add-ons → Install from disk**).
  Later updates arrive in the add-on.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-10-31

- First release.
- Push a Local site's files, database, or both to a Kinsta environment, live or staging.
- Pull them back into an existing Local site, or into a brand-new Local site.
- Compare files on both sides and push or pull only the ones you pick.
- Find sites and environments with a Kinsta API key, or connect with SFTP/SSH credentials.
- Take a Kinsta backup before pushing, and clear Kinsta's cache after.
